Knockout.js Form Demo
===

This is a demo of a form generation template built with Knockout.js. The page consumes a scheme contained inside demo.js, and uses Knockout to loop through the form fields and display the individual components.

I used the knockout-switch-case plugin; alternatively just switch out the Knockout template name.

The scheme also shows an example of "compound fields" that can include multiple child components.
